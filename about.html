                      <p>My name is Suresh Janiga. I am from Hyderabad, India. I am currently studying Postgraduation in Lambton College, Toronto. I have completed under graduation in Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) in 2019. 
                        I have always wanted to become a software engineer. When I was in my Bachelor’s, 3 of my classmates and I worked on a project called “Exoskeleton Humanoid Robot”. The main objective of the project was to implement idea of replacing the humans in dangerous circumstances such as land mine detecting and diffusing as well. The robot will be operated over a Wi-Fi from a limited distance. In this project I mainly contributed to developing and programming Arduino Microcontroller to take the input from the user in C++ language. Also, I worked on the documentation of the project. We successfully implemented the project and presented the project in our college at Tech Expo as a result of it we received A grade for our team. 
                        Currently, I’m pursuing Mobile Application Design and Development at Lambton College Toronto. In this program I have learned all-platform approach such as IOS, Android, Web Development. With a group of 4 members, we have designed and developed Notes App for both Android and IOS mobiles. For the web development, by using open-source Weather API individually, I have created a website where people can check the weather updates using a web browser.
                        So yeah, I have always fascinated by the Information Technology Advancements and would love to be a successful Software developer in the coming future.
