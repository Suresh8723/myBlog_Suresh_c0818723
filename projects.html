                        <p class="matter">I enjoy the learning opportunities working in a team environment provides. I've worked with many knowledgeable people and learned new concepts and techniques from their experience. There's an exciting dynamic in an effective team when everyone understands the common goal and their personal role. I've volunteered to be on several large scope project teams in my previous positions and enjoy the motivation a team environment offers.
                            I'm a natural leader, but a project's success is always my top priority. I'm just as happy taking direction from one of my colleagues if that's what the team dynamic calls for. I'm goal-oriented, so I can work in any capacity to reach my team's deadlines and targets. Even when I'm not in a leadership role, I like to motivate and encourage my team members.
                            In my experience, I've noticed there are universal qualities of an effective team, regardless of its size or company. These include open-mindedness, respect, a clear understanding of the common goal, willingness to contribute, and open communication. I believe that while collaboration is important within an effective team, so is the quality and confidence of its leadership.

                        I have developed a Weather Application using publicly available Weather API. With this app, users can
                        get weather forecast updates in their mobile phones and computer browsers. I have used HTML, CSS,
                        Bootstrap, JavaScript for the frontend of the application and lava, Apache server, and MySQL for the
                        backend of the application.</p>
